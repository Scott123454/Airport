Airport
=======

This exercise models the workings of a simple air traffic control.  

The code was developed using TDD and RSPEC in Ruby. The code utilises classes, instance methods and a module for weather 
conditions.

Plane objects either have teh status of flying or landed.  The airport can accept planes to land in good weather conditions,
however when stormy the planes can neither take off or land.  

To generate the weather conditions a random number generator Ruby method was used.
